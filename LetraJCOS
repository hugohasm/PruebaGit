I Put a Spell on You


I  put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You better stop the things you do

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You know I love you

I love you
I love you anyhow
And I don't care if you don't want me
I'm yours right now
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You knowâ€¦
